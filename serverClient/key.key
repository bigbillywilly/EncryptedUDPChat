# key.key
# This file stores your encryption key in bytes

# How it is created:
# - By calling `generate_key()` from encryption.py

# Why this file matters:
# - Without this key, encryption/decryption will fail
# - This file MUST be copied/shared between client and server

# NEVER commit this file to GitHub in a real secure system.
# This is fine for learning, but in production you would use a key exchange system.
