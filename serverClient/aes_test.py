# aes_test.py
# Used for quick standalone testing of encryption functions

# Example Use:
# - Encrypt a sample message
# - Decrypt it and print to verify correctness

# Why this file matters:
# - Great for debugging encryption logic
# - Lets you confirm the key is being loaded correctly
# - Useful before wiring everything into client/server

# You don’t need to use this in production — just for testing
